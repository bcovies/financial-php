# financial-php

## My first project! 

##### This project was made only by me back in 2018 with no sense of programming by me. I've learned a lot!
##### With this project, for the first time, put every single concept that I have learned in collage in practice. SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS and a little of JS was the languages that was used. More informations will be added lately.
##### A docker feature will be available in the future, as images and other tutorial stuff.
